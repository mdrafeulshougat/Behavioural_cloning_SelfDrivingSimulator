Different models are created with different training data from the simulator in training mode.

Used:
- Convolutional neural net architecture developed by NVIDIA.
- Camera data from three different sides set in the front as the inputs.
- Output variable is the steering angle.
-Trained with one track and used a different track for test purpose.
- Applied a series of image processing techniques on the collected images.
